## SARI -- Security & ARtificial Intelligence Lab 

### Welcome to SARI: Security and ARtificial Intelligence Lab at University *of* New Haven. 

**SARI** is the ultimate space for students and professors to work on research projects together! The lab aims at fostering students’ interest and participation in research projects.
Our research objectives are centered around the following thrusts:

- Modeling more resilient IoT systems, cloud and wireless sensor technology toward cyber-attacks using cryptography, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and data analytics.
- Reverse engineering, malware analysis, and cyber forensics.
- AI security and trustworthiness, and AI applications in cybersecurity.

We believe in actively engaging students and pursuing research that encourage diversity and inclusion. *“We lead the lab and we set the lab culture”*.

### Hack The Box 

Team members enjoy pwning Hack The Box machines. 
Take a look at our [mini-walkthroughs](htb/htb.md). The idea is to represent each box as a tree of hints in a very compact manner. No need to go through lengthy tutorials.
